# 1 - assign_ancestries_to_IIDs.R

# This script runs the ancestral grouping code found on the homepage of Prive et
# al's github page for the UKBB-PGS project: https://github.com/privefl/UKBB-PGS
# It produces a tsv file containing the IIDs of everyone in UKBB, their ancestry
# (according to Prive's method), and whether they self identify as white-British)
# It also randomly samples individuals from each ancestry to use for a future
# calculation.
